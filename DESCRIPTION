Description: path.cat unwinds '..' into actually removing last folder from the
    path. make.path.relative finds the youngest common ancestor of both directories,
    and removes it from the path given in the second argument (target.path) All
    functions allow for mixing '/' with '\' on each path, treating both characters
    equally (so you can't have a filename with backslash even if you are on Linux)
